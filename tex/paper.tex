\section{Compiling Locally}

\subsection{Prerequisites}

Compiling locally is possible with any LaTeX distribution; the github actions workflow running on Ubuntu 20.04 uses the following packages (all installable via `apt`):

\subsection*{Mandatory}
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item \texttt{texlive-latex-recommended}
	\item \texttt{texlive-latex-extra}
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Optional}
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item \texttt{texlive-latex-utils} \quad (for \texttt{texcount})
	\item \texttt{rubber} \quad (for using the \texttt{Makefile})
	\item \texttt{perl} \quad (for \texttt{texcount} and \texttt{latexdiff})
	\item \texttt{latexdiff}
	
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Makefile}

For convenience a Makefile is included which relies on the [rubber](https://gitlab.com/latex-rubber/rubber/) LaTeX wrapper:


\begin{center}
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,morekeywords={make}]
	$ make             # generate paper.pdf
	$ make clean       # cleanup
	$ make spellcheck  # run codespell
	$ make count       # run TexCount
	$ make diff        # run latexdiff with master
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{center}
